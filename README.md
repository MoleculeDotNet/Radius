Radius Wearables Core

The Radius Wearables Core (RWC) is a .Net Micro Framework codebase and accompanying Windows, Windows Phone, Android and iOS companion apps, 
all written in managed code. The idea behind the RWC is to create an integrated software framework for connected wearables - watches, pendants, 
and all manner of headless devices too.

The RWC software is free and open-source for non-commercial uses. Commercial use requires a separate license. Distribution of the mobile phone 
companion apps through app stores involves a separate approval process through Microsoft, Apple and/or Google, though it is intended that the 
default app (which we will publish) will accomodate custom wearable devices you might create. The RWC software is tested on the Radius, Molecule, 
IoT Dx Blue, and GHI hardware.
